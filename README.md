# Buy Me Gift Site Simulation

## Overview

I found this project I did when I was 17... I submitted it for matriculation in computer science. Although it is really strange and tries to simulate a website in a Windows application, and for some unknown reason also contains a kind of message box that imitates Gmail in a non-internet way, apparently the tester enjoyed the idea or the execution and gave me a score of 100.

It is basically a site that imitates the "Buy Me" gift site with the addition of a wish list so that each buyer can buy the recipient the gift they would like. The idea is indeed cute - and it's really strange that it is not implemented on the original website.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: .NET - C#
- **Framework**: WinForms
- **Database**: Microsoft Access (sorry...)

## Known Issues

- There may be problems running the project because I used one of the forms in a music file that is not in this repository.
